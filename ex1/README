ASSIGNMENT 1:
What does the file WhatIDo does?
well, after running strace on the file we can see that the file opens "Welcome/To/OS2018" with openat and checks that the folder is not in use.
writes to the directory: 

MYCSNAME
If you haven't read the course guidelines yet --- do it right now!

closes the folder unlinks it from the write command, then removes the whole path folder by folder and quits.
