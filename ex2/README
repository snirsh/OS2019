ANSWERS:
1.  for example, when using a messaging application,
    we want to be able to still recieve new messages
    even while we are writing, like WhatsApp (Desktop).
    In order to do so we can create a task that schedules
    reading and writing from and to the WhatsApp remote 
    servers.
    In order to do so we can use user-level threads that
    schedule reading and writing correctly.
    As seen in class, user-level threads switching costs
    less that kernel-level.
    Because we are looking for better thread switching
    and to support alot of switching for the user,
    we'll prefer using user-level threads.

| Switching between tabs costs less | No multi-core performance          |
|                                   | (Loading few tabs simultaneously)  |
+-----------------------------------+------------------------------------+
| Each tab has it's own resources   | Can't share data even if they have |
|                                   | Common data to share               |
|                                   | (like marketing information,       |
|                                   |  User preferences etc)             |
+-----------------------------------+------------------------------------+
| Scheduling between tabs           |                                    |
| can be more precise and specific  |                                    |
